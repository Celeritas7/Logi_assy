The printout generated by the svg and png is aligning the image perfectly but as shown in the attached image there is a black background below the arrow. I want to remove it.

Also I have noticed in this diagram that the arrow head end point is fixed at one particular location on the block bcz of that sometimes the arrowhead is visible and sometimes it is not. Can you generate the logic for that so that the arrow end point should keep on changing based on the angle between the parent block and child block.






Is there any way to fix the children location based on the parent? Currently everything is like a balloon initially. And after that it freezes the block positions. I just want after fixing the positions of blocks if I move the parent block all the children blocks should move along with it.




Can I write a logic such that all the sheet tabs of my google sheet will be automatically detected (google sheet tab ID) by the index.html and autogenerate the dropdown list from that.
