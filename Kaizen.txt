Everytime I have to assig the google sheet IDs manually. Can I manually add them from the app? Or in other way, Can I write a logic such that all the sheet tabs of my google sheet will be automatically detected (google sheet tab ID) and autogenerate the dropdown list from that.






Is there any way to fix the children location based on the parent? Currently everything is like a balloon initially. And after that it freezes the block positions. I just want after fixing the positions of blocks if I move the parent block all the children blocks should move along with it.
