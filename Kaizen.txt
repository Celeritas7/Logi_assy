Is there any way to fix the children location based on the parent? Currently everything is like a balloon initially. And after that it freezes the block positions. I just want after fixing the positions of blocks if I move the parent block all the children blocks should move along with it.




Can I write a logic such that all the sheet tabs of my google sheet will be automatically detected (google sheet tab ID) by the index.html and autogenerate the dropdown list from that.
