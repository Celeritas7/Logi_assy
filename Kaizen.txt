I want the Fastener to be visible in the arrow which connects 2 blocks.

Want to file to take input as csv file online. SO that the markings of completed assembly will be visible inside the tree directly.


Want to launch it on cloud as it can be visble to anyone with the link to check the progress.



I want the tree to be like the sun ray shape
