Now next step. Lets have a discussion before that. As you can see I'm trying to set the child with many parents. but im not able to do it with current setup.

image 1-2: I tried ";" sign but it is not generating any result in the tree.

image 3-4: I have generated many rows for that but it duplicates the children.

Can this be managed with the code? either way a block with same name should not exist right?





Don't generate any code just take input of my next upgrades. Lets discuss before implementing them.
1. Want to file to take input as csv file online. SO that the markings of completed assembly will be visible inside the tree directly. 
2. I want the tree to be like the sun ray shape.



Lets have a discussion abour the following points before generating any code,
1. Current tree layout is spearding across entire page when only one level 
Download as image but the map is not fitting in it. any option for that?




The tree should expandable from the right to left.
